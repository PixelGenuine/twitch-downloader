Twitch Downloader allows you to download clips from Twitch in one click. Its compatible with Google Chrome & Mozilla Firefox, more browser support will be coming in the future.

Downloading Twitch clips use to be an easy thing to do, it was a matter of right clicking on a video and hitting save video as. But recently Twitch did some refactoring to how their clip viewer works, and as a result the ability to save video was lost. Its a tedious process for non-technical users to download clips now, enter Twitch Downloader... this extension places a download button on the video player control bar to allow to quickly and easily download any clip you want. It works with a click of a button.
