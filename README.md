**This repository has been archived**.

Due to being busy with school as well as working on other projects, I have decided to pull listing of Twitch Downloader from the Chrome Web Store and Firefox Add-ons marketplaces respectively. Furthermore, I decided to archive this repo for archival purposes (duh) instead of outright deleting it. 

The source code will remain fully available to clone and download, although be warned it may not be functional as Twitch has made significant changes to their frontend since the last time Twitch Downloader was updated.

The copyright license has been changed from GNU General Public License v3.0 to an MIT license, this gives even more freedom to anyone who wishes to update or redistribute this project under a different name (I have actually received a lot of negative feedback over the name because of its vagueness, and rightfully so honestly... It should've been Twitch Clip Downloader.) 

And finally, this project was fun to make and briefly update I learned a lot from it. It also helped a lot of twitch users easily download clips while it was alive. If you're looking for a better alternative, I recommend [Twitch Clip Downloader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitch-clip-downloader/klkjnhemebjdikndlpknonjedeefkedk)

~~Twitch Downloader allows you to download clips from Twitch in one click. Its compatible with Google Chrome & Mozilla Firefox, more browser support will be coming in the future.~~

~~Downloading Twitch clips use to be an easy thing to do, it was a matter of right clicking on a video and hitting save video as. But recently Twitch did some refactoring to how their clip viewer works, and as a result the ability to save video was lost. Its a tedious process for non-technical users to download clips now, enter Twitch Downloader... this extension places a download button on the video player control bar to allow to quickly and easily download any clip you want. It works with a click of a button.~~

~~Twitch Downloader can:
- Download clips and VOD(s) from Twitch in one Click~~
~~- Automatically rename downloaded files (only for clips)~~
